#Experimental approaches: Buzz pollination

##Introduction

**Buzz pollination** is a mode of pollination that involves insects, usually bees, using high frequency vibrations to remove pollen from flowers.

Most insects capable of buzz pollination are bees. Bees use their thoracic flight muscles to produce high frequency vibrations (hundreds of Hz). The vibrations are transmitted to the flower through the contact between the pollinator's body and the floral organs, usually the anthers. 

Buzz-pollination is often used to refere to the phenomenon of producing vibrations to extract pollen from flowers. However, 'pollination' implies the transfer of pollen between anthers and stigmas, so it is useful to differentiate the process of producing vibrations (sonication), and the reproductive consequences for the plant (pollination). See glossary below.

###Glossary

* **Sonication:** A behaviour displayed by some insects, usually bees, that involves the production of high frequency vibrations to facilitate pollen collection.
* **Buzz-pollination:** A type of pollination in which pollen transfer is mediated by insects that use high frequency vibrations to collect pollen grains. It usually, but not always, involves plant species with non-dehiscent anthers, including poricidal anthers.
* **Poricidal anthers:** Non-dehiscent anthers that open through small pores or slits, usually at the distal end of the anther.
* **Stamen:** Male reproductive organ of angiosperms that is formed of a filament and an anther containing the pollen grains.
