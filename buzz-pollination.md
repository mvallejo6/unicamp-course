#Experimental approaches: Buzz pollination
-----

##Introduction

**Buzz pollination** is a mode of pollination that involves insects, usually bees, using high frequency vibrations to remove pollen from flowers.

Most insects capable of buzz pollination are bees. Bees use their thoracic flight muscles to produce high frequency vibrations (hundreds of Hz). The vibrations are transmitted to the flower through the contact between the pollinator's body and the floral organs, usually the anthers. 

Buzz-pollination is often used to refere to the phenomenon of producing vibrations to extract pollen from flowers. However, 'pollination' implies the transfer of pollen between anthers and stigmas, so it is useful to differentiate the process of producing vibrations (sonication), and the reproductive consequences for the plant (pollination). See glossary below.

##Analysis of vibrations
Studies of buzz pollination often require characterising the types of vibrations produced by bees while extracting pollen.

Vibrations can be experimentally studied in two ways:

1. **Direct approaches.** Involve analysing the charactersitics of the vibrating bodies themselves. The vibrating body could be the bee, or the flower that is directly into contact with the bee. Direct measurements of vibrations can be made with specialist equipment such as a [laser Doppler vibrometer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser_Doppler_vibrometer). An example of a laser vibrometer that our lab has used in the past can be found here: [Laser vibrometer](http://www.polytec.com/uk/products/vibration-sensors/single-point-vibrometers/complete-systems/pdv-100-portable-digital-vibrometer/)

2. **Indirect approaches.** Involve analysing the byproduct of the vibrations produced by the bee. The vibrations produced by the bee and transmitted to the flower, result in an audible signal: the "buzz" in buzz-pollination. This acoustic signal can be recorded and analysed using an audio recorder. The advantage of recording the acoustic signal produced during **sonication** is that this can be done with relatively simple equipment (your mobile phone may give you a good first approximation to the characteristics of a buzz). The disadvantages include the intrusion of background noise (from wind to bird calls), which can render a recording useless. Additionally, some parameters of the buzz, such as intensity or amplitude are heavily affected by the distance between the recording apparatus and the bee, and hence it is difficult to get accurate measurements of buzz intensity under field conditions.

##Machine learning


In 2015, a Slovenian data scientist [Bostjan Kalusza](http://bostjankaluza.net/classifying-animal-sounds/) and his colleagues, developed a new approach at analysing buzzing sounds. They used machine learning techniques to train a computer program to recognise some of the main European species of bumblebees. The paper can be found [here](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09524622.2016.1190946).

The result allows users to input a sound file (in *.wav* format) into a webpage, and the program will return the three most likely hits of what the bumblebee species may bee. You can try it in the link below.

[Automatic recognition of European bumblebees] (http://animal-sounds.ijs.si/recognition/bumblebees)

Because the algorthim only works at the moment with European species, I have made available a sound file from a bee we recorded in Scotland. The file is of a worker of *Bombus terrestris* visiting a flower of *Solanum rostratum*.

To try this automatic recognition software, follow these steps:

1. Download the sample buzz file (.wav format) from: [www.plant-evolution.org/campinas](http://www.plant-evolution.org/campinas), and save this file to your local computer.
2. Navigate to Animal Sounds website [http://animal-sounds.ijs.si](http://animal-sounds.ijs.si)
2. Navigate to *Bumblebees* and click *Recognize*
3. Upload the sound file. The sounds recognistion will start automatically
4. The result will we a list of candidate species as identified by the machine-learning algorithm in rank order.

###Glossary

* **Sonication:** A behaviour displayed by some insects, usually bees, that involves the production of high frequency vibrations to facilitate pollen collection.
* **Buzz-pollination:** A type of pollination in which pollen transfer is mediated by insects that use high frequency vibrations to collect pollen grains. It usually, but not always, involves plant species with non-dehiscent anthers, including poricidal anthers.
* **Poricidal anthers:** Non-dehiscent anthers that open through small pores or slits, usually at the distal end of the anther.
* **Stamen:** Male reproductive organ of angiosperms that is formed of a filament and an anther containing the pollen grains.
