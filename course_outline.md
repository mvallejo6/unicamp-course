# Experimental and Theoretical Approaches to Plant Reproductive Diversity

*University of Campinas, São Paulo, Brazil.*

20-22 March, 2017

Mario Vallejo-Marín

# Summary

The goal of this course is to provide students with a general overview and basic understanding of some of the methods and approaches available to study plant reproductive diversity. I will focus on some of the less studied and most challenging aspects of studying reproductive diversity. In the first day we will focus on experimental studies on **buzz-pollination** , a widespread but little known pollination system in which bees use high frequency vibrations to extract pollen. In the second day, we will talk about **plants that combine sexual and asexual reproductive modes**. We will discuss the challenges of measuring fitness in perennial, clonal plants, and provide some theoretical and statistical tools developed for studying clonal populations. Finally, in the third day we will focus on **estimating male reproductive success via male function**. Although most flowering plants are hermaphrodites, male components of fitness are rarely considered, in part because they are hard to measure. Here we will explain some of the approaches (experimental and theoretical) available to study male fitness.

The course will be delivered through a mix of lectures, discussion groups, data collection in the field, and computer exercises.

1. **Experimental approaches: A case study with buzz-pollination**

  1. Floral adaptations to buzz-pollination
  2. Pollinator behaviour and learning
  3. Analysis of vibrations

2. **Sexual vs. asexual strategies**

  1. Reproductive allocation trade-offs
  2. Asexual strategies: What is fitness and how to measure it?
  3. Challenges to measure fitness in perennial, clonal plants
  4. Life-table response experiments

3. **Estimating reproductive success via male function**

  1. Indirect approaches: pollen dyes, flower number
  2. Genetic approaches: phenotypic markers,
  3. Genetic approaches: paternity analysis
