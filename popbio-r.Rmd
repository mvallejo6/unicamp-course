## Analysis with *POPBIO*

Here we will use the `library(popbio)` to analyse population projection models. *popbio* is an package that implements the equations from Caswell (2001), and Morris and Doak (2002) to study matrix populations models.

`popbio` also contains functions to calculate vital rates and construct projection matrices from raw census datas, as is typical of plant demography studies.

Firs load the library:

```{r load popbio, echo=TRUE}
library(popbio)
```
